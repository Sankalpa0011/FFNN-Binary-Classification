## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Feed-Forward Neural Network for binary classification. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset to predict a binary outcome.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file. The data is preprocessed before being fed into the neural network. The preprocessing steps include normalization and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture

The FFNN model is built using the Keras Sequential API. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Training

The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training process involves feeding the model with training data and validating it on a separate validation set.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
precision = tf.keras.metrics.Precision()
recall = tf.keras.metrics.Recall()
precision.update_state(y_test, y_pred)
recall.update_state(y_test, y_pred)
```

## Results

The results of the model evaluation are as follows:

- **Accuracy**: `accuracy_value`
- **Precision**: `precision_value`
- **Recall**: `recall_value`

## Usage
